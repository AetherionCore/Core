LeagueServer is an open-source framework designed for hosting multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games. Based on mostly C#.

It is derived from LeagueSandbox, which originates from Hero/Intwars, and is based on the code of that project with changes over time to optimize, improve and cleanup the codebase at the same time as improving the in-game mechanics and functionality.

It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
