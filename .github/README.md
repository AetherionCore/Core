AetherionCore is an open-source framework designed for hosting multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games. Based on mostly C#.

It is based on Hero/Intwars and Core built on the code of that project, with modifications made over time to optimize, improve, and clean up the codebase while enhancing in-game mechanics and functionality.
It is completely open source; community involvement is highly encouraged.
